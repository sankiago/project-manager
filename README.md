# My Backend Project

**Description:**
This is a backend project that I'm building to learn Node.js and Jest. Currently, the project is in its early stages and is missing many features.

**Technologies:**
* Node.js
* Express.js
* Jest (in progress)

**Current Status:**
The project is still under development. The basic project structure and dependencies are set up, but the core functionality is not yet implemented. The Jest configuration is incomplete, and no tests have been written yet.

**Next Steps:**
* Complete Jest configuration and write unit tests.
* Implement user authentication and authorization.
* Create a REST API for CRUD operations.

**Contributing:**
